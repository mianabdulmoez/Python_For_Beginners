# Comparision Operator
# It answers in True and False only

# These are 6 Comparision Operators
# 1: Equals to                          ==
# 2: Not Equals to                      !=
# 3: Greater than                       >
# 4: Smaller than                       <
# 5: Greater than Equals to             >=
# 6: Smaller than Equals to             <=

x = 20
y = 30

# Equals to
print(x==y)     # 20 is equal to 30 mean     => False
print(x==z)     # 20 is equal to 20 mean     => True    

# Not Equals to
print(x!=y)     # 20 is not equal to 30 mean => True
print(x!=z)     # 20 is not equal to 20 mean => False    

# Greater than
print(x>y)      # 20 is greater than 30 => False
print(y>z)      # 30 is greater than 20 => True

# Smaller than
print(x<y)      # 20 is smaller than 30 => True
print(y<z)      # 30 is smaller than 20 => Fasle

# Greater than equals to
print(x>=y)      # 20 is greater than equals to 30 => False
print(y>=z)      # 30 is greater than equals to 20 => True

# Smaller than equals to
print(x<y)      # 20 is smaller than equals to 30 => True
print(y<z)      # 30 is smaller than equals to 20 => Fasle
