# Tuple Rules

# Ordered
# Items in the tuple have a defined order, and that order will not change. If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list

# Unchangeable
# Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

# Allow Duplicates
# Duplicate items are allowed in any tuple
