# List Rules

# Ordered
# Items in the list have a defined order, and that order will not change. If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list

# Changeable
# The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

# Allow Duplicates
# Duplicate items are allowed in any list
